# Designing User Flow for iGPS Processes

### Goal
The main goal is to use <em>some</em> method to reevaluate the iGPS web applications, to identify pain points and improve the user experience for the various processes (i.e. term planning, registration, etc).

For this exercise, we are taking a step back by creating user flows for various iGPS Processes. This includes creating personas, and how they may perform certain tasks.

### Personas
These are the personas that we will be creating user flows for:
- New Student	
- New Student with TTO	
- Continuing Student
- Change Major / Academic Objective	
- Transfer Student

### Example of tasks
We are trying to define the level of specificity for the tasks (i.e. more specific or general) that will best serve the purpose of this exercise. Here are some examples of tasks that we are designing the user flows for: 
- I want to find out which courses I need to take for the upcoming semester.
- I want to register for the courses I find.
- I want to save the courses that I find so that I can come back and review them later.
- I want to review a previously saved course.
- I want to know if the courses Iâ€™ve saved have available classes that I can register for.
